PartyUp!

Are you tired of that one guy that hijacks the sound-system ? Have you ever wanted to see the party from another point of view ?

Then PartyUp! is the app you need ! You can host a private room for your party where everyone using PartyUp! can connect. With its collaborative playlist system your guests are able to suggest and vote for different tracks and stream them from Spotify. You can also take pictures which are stored and displayed only at the end of the party. Do you wonder what the title of this song you heard was ? Don't worry, find it afterwards with the complete playlist as well as all the memories of the night !
